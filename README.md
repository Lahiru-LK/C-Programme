C is a procedural language, which means that programs are written as a series of functions. Each function performs a specific task, and functions can be called from other functions. This makes C code easy to read and understand, and it also makes it easy to reuse code.

C is a compiled language, which means that it is converted to machine code before it is executed. This makes C code very efficient, and it also makes it portable to different platforms.

C is a powerful and versatile language that is used by many programmers around the world. It is a good choice for learning how to program, and it is also a good choice for creating high-performance software.
